    <p id="pageTextAbout">
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My name is Brad and I love working with computers. Learning is something I enjoy.
        I grew up in a small rural town in Iowa. I ended up moving to Des Moines, IA
        and got my first professional job with Wells Fargo. During my time with the company I worked in
        various roles, starting out in collections. After a bit of time, I became a financial crimes specialist
        and worked on all types of fraud investigations helping to safeguard customer information and data.
        <br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This period of time was one of the best learning experiences I've had.
        I gained invaluable knowledge regarding best industry practices. I reviewed many transactional fraud cases for debit and credit
        products early on. This was more of detection type work. After proving myself, I moved on to investigating fraudulent credit
        applications, and helping to prevent voice facilitated fraud. These included real-time account takeover scenarios.
        Very exciting work!
        <br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the last roles I held in the financial crimes area was working
        specifically with high profile fraud dispute cases. I learned a lot about the VISA and Mastercard arbitration process
        and tried to resolve disputes by contacting the customer, as well as merchants to come to make a final decision on how
        to move forward with the disputed transactions in question.
        <br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last role I held there was as a quality assurance analyst for credit
        bureau disputes. My mission was to ensure that agents in the Phillipines processing disputes were adhering to industry rules
        and regulations before data was transmitted to the bureaus. Also, I would send coaching oppourtunities if I found discrepancies.
        I would also have a few agents I reviewed in the United States as well.
        <br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To summarize, I just want to say that I enjoyed this type of work thoroughly.
        I love solving puzzles, and performing root cause analysis. I was honored to be able to help bring justice to people who were
        being taken advantage of, and this really opened my eyes to security threats in all areas of life. Since I have left the company
        I've decided to devote my full attention to software development, learning how to build safe, realiable, and accessible systems
        to match your business needs.
        <br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my freetime I enjoy playing games with my friends online, and learning more
        about cryptography. I also hold a cybersecurity certification that showcases my general knowledge in cybersecurity
        practices.&nbsp;<img id="cursorLine" src="../media/cursorLine.gif" alt="Blinking cursor line to indicate end of text for design">
